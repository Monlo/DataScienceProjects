  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <p>I'm Monserrat Lopez! I am a Mexican economist currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science for Public Policy at the Hertie School. I have over six years of professional experience conducting data-driven research and policy analysis. My passion is to use data for social good and to find policy solutions. I'm in a constant learning process and in this repository I want to save and share my learning journey and my work.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Monlo/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/01_MachineLearning_WeatherPrediction%20/code.ipynb">Using Machine Learning to Predict Weather</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project is part of my DataQuest Portfolio and aims to predict local weather using machine learning, using weather data from a station at the Oakland International Airport. </p>
      <p><strong>Tools/Technologies:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn (Sklearn).</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> In this project, I utilized Ridge regression, a linear regression technique with regularization, for predicting maximum temperature based on historical weather data. The Mean Absolute Error of the first model was approximately 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit. However, by including more predictors in the model, the MAE decreased to approximately 3.3 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
