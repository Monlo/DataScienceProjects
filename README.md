  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <p>I'm Monserrat Lopez! I am a Mexican economist currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science for Public Policy at the Hertie School. I have over six years of professional experience conducting data-driven research and policy analysis. My passion is to use data for social good and to find policy solutions. In this repository I want to save and share my Data Science learning journey and my work.</p>

  <p>Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Monlo/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/01_MachineLearning_WeatherPrediction%20/code.ipynb">Using Machine Learning to Predict Weather</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project is part of my DataQuest Portfolio and aims to use a Machin Learning model (Ridge Regression) to predict local weather, using weather data from a station at the Oakland International Airport. </p>
      <p><strong>Tools/Technologies:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> In this project, I utilized Ridge regression models for predicting maximum temperature based on historical weather data. The Mean Absolute Error of the first estimated model was approximately 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit. However, by including more predictors in the model, the MAE decreased to approximately 3.3 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
